Delhi's history dates back thousands of years, with evidence of 
settlements dating as far back as the 6th century BCE. Over the

Jahan in the 17th century. This magnificent fortress, with its imposing 
red sandstone walls and intricate marble structures, is a testament to 
the grandeur of Mughal architecture. 
 
Delhi is also home to the Qutub Minar, the tallest brick minaret in the

quality is among the worst in the world, with high levels of particulate 
matter and other pollutants posing serious health risks to its residents. 
Factors such as vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, and 
construction activities contribute to Delhi's air pollution problem,

public transportation, and the introduction of cleaner fuel options.

and safeguard the health and well-being of Delhi's residents.
